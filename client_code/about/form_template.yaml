        Each auction begins with a minimum starting bid. Every new bid must be larger than the prior bid by the Minimum Bid Increment. In this auction, it is 20%.

        When a new bid is placed, the prior bidder receives their bid amount back. Then, the difference between the new bid and the prior bid is split in half between the auctioneer and the prior bidder. In this auction, the auctioneer is burning its half of the split.

        If you participate in the auction, you will either win the prize or earn from the person bidding after you.
